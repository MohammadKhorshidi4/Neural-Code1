# Neural-Code1
Here you can find one of the Advance neuroscience projects. In this Project, there are simulations and extras of Softky and Koch paper "The highly irregular firing of cortical cells is inconsistent with temporal integration of random EPSPs".
For the Codes you can connect me through my email. (The codes were removed for teaching purpose)
